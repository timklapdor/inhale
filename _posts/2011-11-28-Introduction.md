In seven weeks I’ll have made my first human. I’ll join the elite group know as Dads. Yep, I’m having a baby – well my wife will be doing most of the work – but I’ll be there too!

So as a gift to my child I’m starting this blog.

You see your Dad has been around for 31 years now and he’s picked up some knowledge on how this big ol’ world operates. So rather than keep it to myself, I’ll write it here – as some kind of eternal handbook you can refer to. Your Dad isn’t a vain man – I’ll admit I made some mistakes on the way through life. But through these mistakes and the experiences of life I’ve learnt things, I’ve gathered wisdom. Wisdom about what to do and what not to do. Things that I think you should experience for yourself and things you should really stay away from.

I want you to go out and learn and to teach yourself about life. I want you to grow into an independent person, to make your own mistakes and make your own decisions. But have a listen to your old man, learn from him too.

Please know that your Dad will always love you. There’s nothing you can do to change that. Literally – Nothing!
